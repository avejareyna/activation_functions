# Activation functions
This project's goal is to show how to plot 8 different types of common activation funcions.

## Summary of functions

### Step function
Returns 0 if the input is less than 0, and 1 if it's greater or equal than 0

### Sigmoid function
Transforms the input into a value between 0 and 1

### Gaussian function
Returns a bell shaped curve centered in 0

### Identity function
Returns the same input without any modifications

### Piecewise linear function
Combines linear segments to form a non-linear function

### ReLU funcion (Rectified Linear Unit)
Returns 0 if the input is negative and the same input if it's positive

### Sine funcion
Returns the sine of the input

### Hyperbolic tangent
Transforms the input into a value between -1 and 1
